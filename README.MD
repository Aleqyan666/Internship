### Backend Technologies

Python, complemented by a suite of versatile libraries such as SQL Alchemy and Pandas, formed the backbone of our backend development. This combination empowered us with extensive capabilities for managing data effectively throughout the project lifecycle. In particular, our model.py housed meticulously crafted database models, defining the structure and relationships crucial for our PostgreSQL database. Meanwhile, data_ingest.py played a pivotal role in seamlessly populating these tables with relevant data, ensuring a comprehensive and up-to-date repository. Additionally, database.py facilitated secure and efficient connections to our database, enabling robust data interactions and management operations.

### Database Models

Various database models have been meticulously designed using SQLAlchemy's ORM capabilities, incorporating features like foreign keys to ensure robust data organization and efficient querying within our PostgreSQL database. These models are tailored to diverse data scenarios, optimizing data integrity and retrieval for specific project needs.

### Analytics Techniques

Analytics forms a cornerstone of our project, employing advanced techniques such statistical analysis, and data visualization tools. These techniques enable us to derive valuable insights. The aforementioned processes utilized Jupyter Notebooks along with Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and others.
