### Backend Technologies

**Python**, complemented by a suite of versatile libraries such as ***SQLAlchemy*** and ***Pandas***, formed the backbone of our backend development. This combination empowered us with extensive capabilities for managing data effectively throughout the project lifecycle. In particular, our ***model.py*** housed meticulously crafted database models, defining the structure and relationships crucial for our ***PostgreSQL*** database. Meanwhile, ***data_ingest.py*** played a pivotal role in seamlessly populating these tables with relevant data, ensuring a comprehensive and up-to-date repository. Additionally, ***database.py*** facilitated secure and efficient connections to our database, enabling robust data interactions and management operations.

### Database Models

Various database models have been meticulously designed using **SQLAlchemy's ORM capabilities**, incorporating features like foreign keys to ensure robust data organization and efficient querying within our PostgreSQL database. These models are tailored to diverse data scenarios, optimizing data integrity and retrieval for specific project needs.

### Analytics Techniques

Analytics forms a cornerstone of our project, employing advanced techniques such statistical analysis, and data visualization tools. These techniques enable us to derive valuable insights. The aforementioned processes utilized ***Jupyter Notebooks*** along with Python libraries such as ***Pandas***, ***NumPy***, and ***others***.

## Project Structure



### Modular Architecture

To foster maintainability and collaboration, our project adopts a modular architecture. Each component, whether frontend views, backend services, or analytical models, is encapsulated within its own module with clear interfaces and dependencies. 
- **data_analytics**: This directory contains Jupyter Notebook files used for data analysis and visualization.
- **images**: Intended for storing files and images related to pictures and visual content.
- **Recommendation_engine/etl**: 
            ***.env*** securely manages sensitive information and customizes configurations based on different deployment environments (development, testing, production, etc.) without hardcoding them into our application codebase.
            ***requirement.txt*** lists the Python packages required for this project, ensuring compatibility and functionality across different environments. Each package serves a specific purpose.
            ***Dockerfile*** efficiently sets up a Python application in a lightweight `python:3.10-slim-bullseye` container. It manages dependencies and essential system libraries, establishes a working directory, and exposes a port for external access. This streamlined approach enhances deployment consistency, scalability, and security, supporting modern software development practices effectively.
            ***data_ingest.py***, ***database.py***, & ***models.py*** The process involves first establishing a secure connection with the database, followed by meticulously designing and implementing precise database models tailored to the application's data requirements. Subsequently, these models are used to populate database tables with the relevant data, ensuring comprehensive and organized data storage and retrieval capabilities.
- **Recommendation_engine/etl/data**: Houses CSV files utilized for data analytics and various database operations and table interactions.
- **docker-compose.yaml**: orchestrates a development environment with a ***PostgreSQL*** database, ***pgAdmin*** for database management, and a specialized service ***db_setup*** for database initialization tasks. It ensures interdependent services are orchestrated properly, facilitating efficient development, testing, and deployment workflows in a Dockerized environment. Adjustments can be made based on specific project requirements and scaling needs.

## Purpose and Goals

Our project aims to:
- **Deliver a Seamless User Experience**: Integrating frontend and backend technologies to create a cohesive user interface that enhances usability and performance.
- **Ensure Data Integrity and Scalability**: Implementing robust database models and efficient data management practices to support current and future data needs.
- **Drive Informed Decision-Making**: Leveraging advanced analytics techniques to extract actionable insights from data, empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
